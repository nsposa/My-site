          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I'm a confessed life-long learner and autodidact. Initially, I started my journey outside of academia, in the field of value Investing. While mastery has and will continue to be evasive, value investing is an area I will work on
            throughout my career. Aside from the life lessons learned, being mostly self-taught has allowed me to create mental models of how businesses operate. Another improvement that I've seen from honing my research skills is in the area of my
            learn-ability. I've realized some of the best ways to leapfrog learning hurdles in much shorter time frames. These methods are what give me the template necessary to master other diverse areas of deep technical expertise.<br><br> My goal
            for
            this page over the next 1-2 years is to catalog my learning trek. The start of my journey will be in the area of web development. Starting Dec 1, 2019, I enrolled in the Udacity Bootcamp taught by Angela Yu. My end goal is to prove that
            someone with an average academic background can teach themselves the skills necessary to stay competitive in an ever-evolving technological landscape. In order of importance, my plan of attack is 1. Web development 2. Data science
            (including Python, R, Tableau, SQL), and 3. Get hired at a startup in web dev or a VC fund. While the bar has been set extremely high for years 1-2 of Ultralearning, I won't be deterred from achieving success. In the meantime, I will be
            working my day job and helping to create a few, tech-related, startups. </p>

          <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\HR_Laptop_1\Desktop\CSS-My Site\images\invest.png"class="stocks">
            <br>
            <h3>Equity Research</h3>
            <p>A great deal of my time is spent doing exhaustive research on a small portion of the public equity market.
              My concentration lies in the area of franchise businesses and company's with large proverbial MOATS.</p>

            <h3>Web Developement</h3>
            <p>Since high school I've become fascinated with programming. While I staid present with the latest in technology I never really took the leap into object oriented programming.
              More recently, I decided to start my journey by learning full stack web developement through free resources and a web-based <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">bootcamp</a> through Udemy.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="C:\Users\HR_Laptop_1\Desktop\CSS-My Site\images\startup.png"class="stocks">
            <h3>Quantcubes</h3>
            <p>I'm the founder & CEO of Quantcubes. A simplified but highly effective learning + implementation solution for quantitative traders.
              Our technology utilizes the simplicity of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform">low-code developement platform</a>,
              which is a software that allows users to create applications through graphical interfaces as opposed to traditional code. Quantcubes
              allows quantitative traders the ability to both simplify and automate their trading process. </p>
