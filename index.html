          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I'm a confessed life-long learner and autodidact. Initially, I started my journey in the field of value Investing. Using what I've learned through self-teaching, various internships,
            and professional research positions have molded my toolbox of mental models for viewing the world.  <br><br>

          My introduction to programming came in the form of Myspace. For those who aren't familiar it was the predecessor to Facebook. I remember sitting around with friends customizing our page layouts via simple HTML and Photoshop. While it wasn't intended for educational purposes at the time, it allowed me to start
           thinking programmatically. Since then, I would revisit code infrequently without ever delving deep into the craft. This changed when I decided to enter a coding Bootcamp in 2019. I would later realize that this was one of my best ideas! I've now used this skillset to land a promotion at work, start pro bono development jobs, and create my own startup.
            <br><br>

            The goal for this page over the next 1-2 years is to catalog my learning trek. My end goal is to prove that using a self-taught approach can lead to tremendous self-developement. In order of importance,
             my plan of attack is 1. Web development, and 2. Work in web development, product development or VC. While the bar has been set extremely high for years 1-2 of Ultralearning, I've set a clear path to proficiency. In the meantime, I will be working at my day job, and leading the charge at my startup, Quantcubes. </p>

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <img src="invest.png" class="stocks">
            <br>
            <h3>Equity Research</h3>
            <p>A great deal of my time is spent doing exhaustive research on a small portion of the public equity market.
              My concentration lies in the area of franchise businesses and company's with large proverbial <a href="http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Measuring_the_Moat_July2013.pdf">MOATS</a>.</p>

            <h3>Web Developement</h3>
            <p>Since high school I've become fascinated with programming. While I staid present with the latest in technology I never really took the leap into object oriented programming.
              More recently, I decided to start my journey by learning full stack web developement through free resources and a web-based <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">bootcamp</a> through Udemy.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="startup.png" class="stocks">
            <h3>Quantcubes</h3>
            <p>I'm the founder & CEO of Quantcubes. A simplified but highly effective learning + implementation solution for quantitative traders.
              Our technology utilizes the simplicity of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform">low-code developement platform</a>,
              which is a software that allows users to create applications through graphical interfaces as opposed to traditional code. Quantcubes
              allows quantitative traders the ability to both simplify and automate their trading process. </p>
